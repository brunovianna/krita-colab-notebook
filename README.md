# krita-colab-notebook
Google colab notebook to connect as remote server for Krita AI generation


It downloads all required custom nodes, plus the node for downloading models.

It should work with Flux, but it would require a Colab Pro subscription for access to machines with more than 16Gb of VRAM. I couldn't test it, though.

Models can be stored in google drive if you have enough space.
It uses the download model script from https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/
